# Music-Website (Web Programming Project)
Music which is an art of sound in time that expresses ideas and emotions in significant forms through the elements of rhythm, melody, harmony, and color. Music reduces stress, it relieves symptoms of depression. So here I have created a music website where I have customized the songs according to my choice. I done this using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.

We know that music refreshes our minds, gives positive energy and also, I am just fond of music. So, from this perspective I have made my own customized music website where I can add songs according to my choice. In future this project can be used for a large field where I can serve for people by adding attractive and beautiful musicâ€™s. Also, we can perform promotional works through my music website. So, in future I have plans to convert this website in one of the best music websites.
